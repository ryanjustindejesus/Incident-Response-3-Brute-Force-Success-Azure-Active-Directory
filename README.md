- <b>Based on the results, I will conclude this as a False Positive - Inaccurate Data since this was from our host computer by the matching IP address. However, if this is a real incident, we have to investigate further and follow the playbook for successful brute force attempts on Azure Active Directory. If this is within the organization, I would call the user and confirm the details with them. If we determine that the user was doing normal duties as a pentester, and collaborated with their manager to conduct this. Then we can close it. False Positive - Inaccurate Data.

## Incident Management Playbook 
- <b>Incident Description</b>
    - This incident involves observation of potential brute force attempts against a Linux Syslog.

- <b>Initial Response Actions</b>
    - Verify the authenticity of the alert or report.
    - Immediately isolate the machine and change the password of the affected user
    - Identify the origin of the attacks and determine if they are attacking or involved with anything else
    - Determine how and when the attack occurred
        - Are the NSGs not being locked down? If so, check other NSGs
    - Assess the potential impact of the incident.
        - What type of account was it? Permissions?

## Containment and Recovery

- <b>Lock down the NSG assigned to that VM/Subnet, either entirely, or to allow only necessary traffic</b>

- <b>Reset the affected user’s password</b>
